					Back in 2011, Chrissy and Brian found themselves doing what most econ majors and law school graduates were doing at that time: waiting tables. Despite some initial stand-offishness from Chrissy, Brian quickly won her over with a helping hand at the crossword puzzles she would do on slow nights.<br /><br />

					After hanging up their serving aprons, Chrissy and Brian continued to hang out, exploring DC by bike, grilling at home, and seeing more live music than is good for one's hearing. They'd expand their horizons over the next few years, visiting Guatemala, Montreal, Tulum, and many visits to Chicago, Philly, and New York.<br /><br />

					In 2015, Chrissy moved to New York to pursue a new job with Girls Who Code. She and Brian shuffled back and forth between the two cities until 2017, when Brian was offered a job at The New York Times (he took it).<br /><br />

					Reunited in the Big Apple, Chrissy and Brian took a year to settle in and begin to explore the monstorous city. On the anniversary of Brian's move after a dinner of fried chicken, Chrissy asked him to marry her over kitschy cocktails in Nolita. Brian said yes.<br /><br />

					A month later, Chrissy had to ask again because she wasn't sure he knew she was "like, within the next year" serious.
