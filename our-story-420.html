					Brian and Chrissy met in the basement of an Ann Taylor Loft where comedians came to get drunk and occasionally tell jokes. Like most econ majors and law school graduates in 2011, our heroes were waiting tables. Between  getting tipped in pocket change, cleaning up other people's vomit, blacking out at Lucky Bar (ok, that one was just Chrissy), and blazing in the parking garage (just Brian), a loved blossomed between these two humble service workers.<br /><br />

					Brian had all the trappings of an elder millenial hipster that Chrissy found irresistable: an extensive vinyl collection, a fixie (Brian: "Actually, it was a single speed"), and a job at NPR. It is still unclear why Brian liked Chrissy. I mean, she lived in Woodley Park and took him to a motherfucking poetry slam for their first date (he left early to see Future Islands at Black Cat).<br /><br />

					Regardless, after a few months of dating in secret, these star-crossed lovers gave the Improv a big middle finger and broke out on their own. They survived a trip to Guatemala where Brian gave himself giardia drinking a home brewed beer. <br /><br />

					Reunited in the Big Apple, Chrissy and Brian took a year to settle in and begin to explore the monstorous city. On the anniversary of Brian's move after a dinner of fried chicken, Chrissy asked him to marry her over kitschy cocktails in Nolita. Brian said yes.<br /><br />

					A month later, Chrissy had to ask again because she wasn't sure he knew she was "like, within the next year" serious.
